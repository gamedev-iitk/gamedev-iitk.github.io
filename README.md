## About

We're a small group of students passionate about creating video games. With improvements in technology, games are further pushing boundaries and redefining themselves. We're interested in testing these limits and continuously exploring where games can take us as an art form. We’re about creating games and the sheer knowledge one would gain by working on a game would be beneficial in all spheres of life.

## Projects

Some projects that we're working on or have worked on in the past.



## Activities

We regularly host lectures, workshops, game jams and more! Here are some of them.

### Introduction to Video Game Development

![lec1](/assets/lec1.jpg)

An introductory lecture to give an overview of what game development is about. We split the process into three broad sections - programming, design and art. The programming section went over frameworks, game engines, gameplay programming and graphics programming. The design section went over gameplay systems, story and level design. The art section went over choosing a style to complement the game, some popular tools to create 3D art and some examples of actual games. Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KRyublzorT5SvWph-tumIEEnLkqCrWzOOCH7cuQMYVw/edit?usp=sharing).

### Making Games with Unity

![work1](/assets/work1.jpg)

A 3-hour hands-on workshop with Unity. We created a very simple game from scratch but with free assets from the Unity marketplace to demonstrate the entire process of creating a game. Concepts were emphasized, which allows one to switch to some other engine in the future if Unity is not suited to their needs. The final result was meant to cover all important areas of game development like coordinate systems, cameras, rigidbody physics, animation graphs, AI and navigation meshes, character controllers and input handling, etc. The complete code can be seen [here](https://github.com/gamedev-iitk/low-poly-dodgeball).

### Introduction to Art in Games

Notes to help people start creating 3D assets for games with Blender. Mainly refers to the excellent doughnut tutorial by [BlenderGuru](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLGgWrla12dEW5mjO09kR2_TzPqDTXdw), with links to helpful resources to further explain the concepts behind what is what. Covers meshes and modelling with modifiers, sculpting, materials and textures, UV mapping, texture painting, particles, basics of lighting, rendering and compositing. We also go through two GDC talks ([Fortnite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=498KToofNf8) and [Firewatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdxQ3HlhTE8)) explaining their art design choices and the reasons behind what makes their styles successful. Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ssNHy0QoTJPN7iKaRXsq1DeZal9rQTwYrj-TicSZj2c/edit?usp=sharing).

### The Indefinite Break Jam

A 72-hour gamejam in the COVID-19 break to do something productive with the free time at home and create a fun game. The jam was hosted on itch.io and the page can be found [here](https://itch.io/jam/iitk-game-jam).
